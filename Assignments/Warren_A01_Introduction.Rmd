## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have done a little bit of R over the course of different jobs, and a three-day crash course, but no real formal training. I took two semesters of statistics at Sanford, but we used STATA. I always though Git was like Dropbox for code

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I know I like analysis and so will feel pretty motivated most of the time.

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: Keeping everything organized seems pretty intimidating.


## 2) GitHub
